## VCU Virtual Pharmacology Lab Worksheet. I. Single-Drug Dose-Effect Curves

This module generates up to four simulated dose-effect curves based on data you enter for the following variables:

· Doses (enter up to 10 doses)

From the resulting dose-effect curve(s), seek to answer the questions posed by your instructor. 

## VCU Virtual Pharmacology Lab Worksheet. II. Drug Interactions
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VCU-SOM/VPLW/HEAD?labpath=%2Fphase3%2FVCU-VPLW-Phase3b.ipynb)

This module generates simulated dose-effect curves resulting from the combination of two ligands here called Drug A and Drug B (either two different drugs, or a drug in combination with basal tone for an endogenous neurotransmitter). You will enter the following variables

· Doses of Drug A (enter up to 10 doses)

· A single dose of Drug B

From the resulting dose-effect curve(s), seek to answer the questions posed by your instructor.
